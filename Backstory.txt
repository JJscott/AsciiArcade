The year is 2016. Humanity has reached the stars, established relations with other civilizations and is continuing to prosper.

For some, this trversal of space was the a dream come true, a fantasy made reality, the ultimate freedom. But Some people took this new found freedom to the extreme, becoming lawless pirates and criminals. Taking whatever they wanted, whenever they wanted it. It would seem that some things never change.


However, one man's problem is another man's paycheck...

YOU are a Bounty Hunter.

The scumbags of the stars lay low in asteroid fields and you must chase them down before they can escape. The real challenge, however, is being efficient about it. In this is reality ammo, fuel, repairs, these things cost money and the less you use, the more you make off each bounty.

In this day and age there's plenty of bounty's to go around, so much so that hunters like you rarely need to compete against one another. I guess some of us get to live the dream...
