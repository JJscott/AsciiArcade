The year is 30XX. Humanity has reached the stars, established relations with other civilizations and species and is continuing to prosper.

For some space was the ultimate freedom, a fantasy made reality. 

But reality is never a fantasy.

Some people took this new found freedom to the extreme, becoming lawless pirates and criminals. Taking whatever they wanted, whenever they wanted.

It would seem that some things never change. However, another man's problem is another man's paycheck.

This isn't a fantasy, I still have to put food on my table.

The name's ???, a Bounty Hunter.

In this day and age there's plenty of bounty's to go around, so much so that us hunters rarely need to compete against one another. I guess some of us get to live the dream.

Right now I've cornered another low-life in an asteroid field.

I'll have to deal with him before he can escape the field and warp away, piece of cake.

The real challenge is being efficient about it, this is reality. Ammo, fuel, repairs, these things cost money.

The guy's bounty is a set amount of money, it's up to me and my skills to make a larger profit.

And if I do well enough, I may get more than just a piece of that cake.
